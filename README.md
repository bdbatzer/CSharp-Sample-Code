# C# Tools
Here are some tools I've created and found useful for work I've done in C#. They include a KD-tree and Priority Queue implementation designed for maintaining tree data structures like you would find in path planning, an abstracted Particle Filter class with a completed low-variance sampling algorithm (see Thrun, Burgard, and Fox's Probabilistic Robotics), and a basic Kalman Filter with a virtual Predict method to allow support for an EKF implementation
